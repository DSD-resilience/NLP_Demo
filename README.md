# 🧠 NLP Demonstrations with Python

Welcome to the **NLP Demos with Python** repository — a comprehensive collection of practical, hands-on Natural Language Processing (NLP) examples designed to help learners, researchers, and developers understand and apply core NLP concepts using Python.

## 📘 About This Repository

This project aims to bridge theory and practice in NLP by showcasing real-world use cases and techniques, from text preprocessing to advanced deep learning models. Each demonstration is built using well-established Python libraries such as:

* **NLTK** – Natural Language Toolkit for basic text operations.
* **spaCy** – Industrial-strength NLP library for fast tokenization, POS tagging, and NER.
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning tools for vectorization, classification, and clustering.
* **Transformers (Hugging Face)** – Pretrained models for tasks like text generation and question answering.
* **Pandas & Matplotlib** – For data handling and visualization.

## 🔍 What You'll Learn

Through this repository, you’ll explore and gain practical experience with:

* Text cleaning and normalization (lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization)
* Tokenization and POS tagging
* Named Entity Recognition (NER)
* Sentiment analysis using rule-based and machine learning models
* Vectorization techniques (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, word embeddings)
* Topic modeling with LDA
* Text classification pipelines
* Chatbot basics and intent recognition
* Using pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT)
